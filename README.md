# ⚛️ Frontend Techniques in the Realm of Hyrule with React

## 👋🏾 About this Project

Welcome to Frontend Techniques in the Realm of Hyrule with React! Here, you'll find the notes that accompany that talk given by [Bree Hall](https://tiktok.com/@bytesofbree) (that's me!) at [THAT Conference Wisconsin](https://thatconference.com) during the summer of 2024.

This is a beginner friendly presentation on React hooks and dynamic content loading with a fun, Zelda-inspired twist. It’s all about mixing code with creativity, and learning by finding parallels in coding and your passions.

➡️ Check out a [live demo]() of the demo app and presentation slides
